## Nodes

The big advantages of Monologue are its simplicity and flexibility, made possible by its node system.
There are more than a dozen nodes, each with its own distinct functionality, enabling you to create non-linear stories with no restrictions on their structure.

## In-app execution

You can run your storyline directly from the application and from any node.

## JSON

If Monologue is still too limited for you, the files are saved in a JSON file, so you can easily write your own interpreter.
